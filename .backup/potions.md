# Potions

## Healing Potions

| **Potion** | **Description** |
|----------- | --------------- |
| Healing Potion | Restores hit points when consumed. Often red due to its base ingredient: Bloodroot berries. May tingle on the tongue as the magic mends wounds from the inside. |
| Potion of Greater Healing | A brighter, almost glowing red, made potent by the rare Heartfire blossom. Heals greater injuries but may also cause a slight burning sensation as it works. |
| Potion of Lesser Healing | Pale red or pink, brewed with diluted Bloodroot sap. A common item in most healer kits. Tastes faintly of metal or iron. |

| Potion of Invisibility | Clear and faintly shimmering. Created with Shadowcap mushrooms harvested only at night. Drinking it feels like swallowing cold air. Leaves a faint mist behind briefly. |
| Potion of Strength | Deep blue and viscous. Brewed with Troll bone marrow or Lionroot extract, enhancing muscle density for a time. Causes a brief sensation of heaviness as it takes effect. |
| Potion of Speed | A bright, effervescent yellow. Contains Windtail leaves, giving the drinker heightened reflexes and stamina. Has a sharp citrus taste and creates a buzzing sensation in the limbs. |

| Potion of Mind Clarity | A clear potion with a swirling silver shimmer. Brewed with Silverlace petals and Mindfrond extract. Clears mental fog, boosts focus, and resists psychic attacks for a short duration. |
