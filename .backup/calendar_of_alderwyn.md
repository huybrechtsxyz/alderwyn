# Calendar of Alderwyn

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO DO:

Moon-Specific Religious Orders or Sects:

    You already have strong spiritual ties to the Winter Moon (tradition, mortality, divine fate) and the Summer Moon (chaos, adventure, natural forces).
    Are there priesthoods or secret orders dedicated to specific phases or alignments?
    Maybe Nightveil is a sacred pilgrimage time for a reclusive order?

Solar Events and Other Astronomical Features:

    The calendar is lunar-driven, but does the Sun have a role in spiritual, economic, or agricultural traditions?
    Do eclipses have omens or rituals associated with them?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
