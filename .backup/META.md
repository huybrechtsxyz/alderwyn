# Aldarwyn World Meta

## Scope of the World

KEEP TRACK OF WHY YOU’RE CREATING! Stay on track and make your world, campaign or novel the very best it can be! It all starts with a little motivation...

### What is your motivation for building this world?

_Decide what the world is being built for, and what it means to you - that way, it’ll be fit for purpose!_

The goal is to create a dynamic world rich with adventure, where players can forge their own paths through the narrative. The world will provide a canvas for diverse, evolving adventures that are directly woven into its fabric. While the world will be full of excitement and opportunities for fun, it will not shy away from darker moments, inspired by the intensity of Ravenloft or Game of Thrones. At its core, the world also holds a glimmer of hope, reflecting a period of transition where an age of prosperity is fading. The players will be driven to uncover mysteries and shape their own stories by exploring and engaging deeply with the world around them.

### What are you hoping to get out of it?

_Knowing what you want from your world building project will help keep you on track when you get tired or stuck. Are you creating for a novel or a D&D campaign? What kind of experience do you want your audience to have?_

I aim to create an open world that serves as a dynamic stage for both custom adventures and established storylines, seamlessly integrated into the world. It will be a place where players can forge their own destinies, seeking out adventures through exploration and interaction. My goal is to offer an epic experience that combines the aftermath of war, political intrigue, and personal ambition in a world akin to the dramatic intensity of Game of Thrones, with the historical depth of Assassin's Creed set in a Renaissance-inspired world. Through this, I hope players will be able to immerse themselves in an evolving story and create unforgettable moments of triumph, betrayal, and discovery.

### What is the Hook or Unique Selling Point of your world?

_What makes it different? This is the core of your idea, the hook that draws you - and hopefully your players and readers - into the setting of the world. When we say “Unique” we really mean “special to you”. As long as you’re excited about the concept, that’s enough. Don’t feel like you have to reinvent the wheel and come up with something 100% original._

The unique appeal of this world lies in its renaissance-era setting infused with dark fantasy elements, where adventure thrives amid the tension of a fading golden age. Players will experience a world that is both beautiful and dangerous, with opportunities to explore rich, diverse cities, uncover ancient ruins, and navigate political intrigue. At the heart of it all is the clash between the old powers—once untouchable noble houses—and the rising influence of guilds and mercenaries, creating an environment full of shifting allegiances and high stakes. This world offers an epic blend of personal ambition, mystery, and moral ambiguity, where the pursuit of glory and self-improvement takes place on top of a heap of dark secrets, ancient curses, and unsolved mysteries.

## Theme of the World

Instill clarity and consistency to your storytelling. From the darkest dungeon to the brightest rainbow, choose the look and feel of your world, and how noble (or grim) your heroes’ fates will be!

### What’s the Genre of your World?

_Knowing the genre(s) and general technology/magic level will help you set expectations about your world, and keep your world feeling cohesive._

This world falls into the genre of low magic sword and sorcery, set in a renaissance-inspired era. While magic and the gods are real and can significantly influence the world, they are rare and often seen as mysterious or dangerous. The world is shaped by high political intrigue, personal ambition, and the slow decline of old powers. Technology mirrors that of a medieval renaissance, with advancements in art, architecture, and science, yet still heavily reliant on swords, shields, and traditional combat. Magic, when it appears, is awe-inspiring and potent, but not something most people can access or wield on a daily basis. Gods and divine intervention play a crucial role, but their influence is subtle and indirect, often manifesting through their agents or through rare celestial beings. This world is one where human striving, personal struggles, and great quests for glory blend with shadowy forces, lost knowledge, and ancient curses.

### How does the world feel (player/reader experience)?

_Do you want your world to feel mystical, or terrifying - or both? Should your audience be afraid or moved, filled with wanderlust or wonder? Awed by the past, or by the future? Your world will have a general feel to it, even if the specifics of tone vary from story to story._

Alderwyn should feel both exciting and dangerous, with a constant interplay of light and darkness. The world is filled with thrilling adventures, but also brimming with perils that can turn a moment of hope into one of despair. Players will feel the tension of a world on the edge of a new era, where opportunity and danger walk hand in hand. The people in this world are often driven by a need to survive, with few having the luxury of living without fear. Those who can rise above survival are often motivated by the desire to better themselves, driven by ambition or the hope of securing a better future. The world is a place where the environment itself poses a challenge—be it through treacherous terrain, dangerous creatures, or the ever-looming presence of political instability. The mysteries of the past and the uncertainties of the future fill the air, and players will always be aware that every choice they make could shape their fate in ways they can't yet foresee.

### What is the character agency level like?

_Character agency describes how much power the main characters or player characters have to change the world, and how long-lasting that change might be._

In Alderwyn, characters have a high level of agency, with the power to significantly shape the world around them. The world is one where choices matter and the consequences of those choices can ripple across time, affecting the course of events, politics, and even the balance between good and evil. Players will be able to influence major factions, uncover ancient secrets, and change the course of history, but this power comes with responsibility. The world is complex, and the outcomes of their actions may not always be straightforward—mistakes and miscalculations can lead to unintended consequences, and the line between good and bad is often blurred. Whether through diplomacy, combat, or clever scheming, the players' actions will leave a lasting mark on the world, but they will need to constantly navigate the shifting dynamics of power, morality, and survival.

### What is the tone of your world

_Is your world dark (e.g. Game of Thrones, Battlestar Galactica, The Witcher) or bright (e.g. original Star Trek, the Princess bride, My Little Pony), or somewhere in the middle (e.g. StarGate, Harry Potter, Shannara Chronicles)? How pleasant or difficult is it to live there, in general? Do horrible or wondrous things happen to ordinary people?_

The tone of Alderwyn is one of gradual decline mixed with a glimmer of hope for renewal. The world is recovering from the Reckoning, a cataclysmic event that has left its scars on both the land and its people. This has ushered in a golden age that now seems to be fading, as the prosperity of the last kings wanes. While the world has experienced a time of peace and growth, tensions are rising, and the old noble houses are losing their once-immense power to the growing influence of guilds, mercenaries, and new political factions. There is a constant undercurrent of uncertainty, as ancient creatures and dark forces that thrived in the shadows during the Reckoning begin to encroach upon civilization once again.

The tone alternates between moments of hope and despair, beauty and decay, creating a mysterious yet dangerous atmosphere. The players will find themselves navigating a world where light can be blinding, but darkness is always lurking, and every choice they make carries weight. There is a feeling of impermanence, where everything—be it power, peace, or safety—can shift at a moment’s notice. This is a world where moral ambiguity prevails, and epic tales of survival, betrayal, and redemption unfold against a backdrop of ancient ruins, rising powers, and the looming shadow of forgotten horrors.

### What are the recurring themes

_What themes reinforce the genre, tone and feel of your world? A few recurring themes can help anchor your audience in your tone and genre, and establish your hook. What three motifs/scenes/themes capture the world you’re trying to create? Give three to five examples.These motifs are a great way to help reinforce the feeling of your world, despite the different pacing and mood of locations or scenes within your story or campaign. They do not need to feature in every single session or scene._

The recurring themes in Alderwyn help to reinforce its tone, genre, and feel, and act as key pillars for the world’s atmosphere. These motifs tie together the intricate web of darkness and hope, survival and aspiration, creating a world that is both alluring and dangerous.

**Things Seem Fine on the Surface but Are Corrupt Beneath**  
Throughout Alderwyn, places, people, and institutions often appear prosperous, stable, and thriving, but closer inspection reveals corruption, decay, or hidden struggles beneath the veneer. This theme reinforces the sense that all is not as it seems, creating a constant tension where players can never be sure whether they can trust those in power or the society around them. It reflects the fallibility of civilization, where things break down when you scratch the surface, and adds an element of mystery and intrigue.

**The Golden Age Did Not Bring Prosperity for All**  
While Alderwyn was once in the throes of a golden age, not everyone benefited equally. The rich grew wealthier, and the powerful further cemented their control, but common folk and marginalized groups saw little improvement in their lives. The theme of inequality underscores much of the world’s struggles, as new powers and guilds rise while the old noble houses lose their grip. It also sets the stage for class conflicts, as characters navigate a world that may seem filled with opportunity, but for many, survival is still a daily struggle.

**Control vs. Freedom is Not the Same as Order vs. Chaos**  
This theme touches on the complexities of power and agency within Alderwyn. In a world where political intrigue, manipulation, and personal freedom constantly collide, the struggle is not simply between order and chaos but between control and freedom. Those in power often seek to control the lives and choices of others, whether through laws, guilds, or divine influence, but true freedom can be a dangerous and unpredictable force. The tension between these competing forces challenges characters to find their place in a world where balance is precarious and agency often comes with great cost.

**Decay and Ruin as a Result of Forgotten History**  
The theme of ancient empires and long-forgotten civilizations provides a backdrop for much of the world’s setting, where ruins, abandoned cities, and lost knowledge lay scattered across the land. These remnants of past greatness stand as stark reminders of the fleeting nature of power and the inevitable decay that follows empires. This theme invokes a sense of mystery and nostalgia for a time long gone, where characters might seek to uncover secrets from the past or face the consequences of those forgotten mistakes.

These recurring themes tie into the genre of a low-magic sword and sorcery renaissance world, where characters must navigate a complex, shifting landscape of moral ambiguity, personal ambition, and the shadows of history.

### Focus points for Alderwyn

1. **The Decay of the Old Powers**  
  The once-mighty noble houses that ruled the land are now in decline, struggling to maintain their influence as new forces, particularly guilds and mercenaries, rise to power. This collapse of the old order creates fertile ground for political intrigue, rebellion, and betrayal. Players may find themselves embroiled in dynastic struggles, secret conspiracies, or efforts to topple the old guard in favor of new leadership. The tension between the established elite and the rising power of guilds, mercenaries, and even common folk will be a key focus in the world.

2. **Ancient Ruins and Forgotten Knowledge**  
  The world of Alderwyn is littered with the remnants of lost civilizations—ruins, abandoned cities, and ancient tombs that hold powerful relics and forbidden knowledge. These ruins hold the secrets to past empires, long-lost magic, and the mistakes that led to their downfall. Exploring these ancient sites, deciphering long-forgotten lore, and uncovering powerful artifacts will be a significant focus for players seeking to reshape the future or unlock the mysteries of the past. However, these ruins are often filled with dangerous creatures, magical traps, and curses, all of which guard the knowledge and power hidden within.

3. **The Influence of Gods and Divine Agents**  
  Alderwyn is a world where gods actively influence events through their followers and celestial agents. Divine power is wielded through clerics, paladins, and other religious figures, shaping politics, laws, and the fate of nations. While most people pay homage to Ohm, the god of the region, players may encounter rival deities, secret cults, and forbidden religious practices. The celestials—divine messengers, angels, and demons—play a crucial role as well, working in the shadows to further their god’s will. The power of belief will have a lasting impact on the world, with the potential for divine intervention, miracles, or curses depending on the characters’ choices and allegiances.

4. **Political Intrigue and Power Struggles**  
  As the golden age fades and Alderwyn enters a time of uncertainty, the balance of power is constantly shifting. This world is one of political tension, where noble houses, guilds, and mercenaries vie for control over cities, land, and resources. Assassinations, bribes, alliances, and backstabbing are common as characters navigate the intricacies of court politics and factional struggles. The rise of guilds offers new paths to power, but also new threats to old institutions. Players must decide whether to play the political game, help bring about change, or escape it altogether.

5. **The Struggle for Survival and Advancement**  
  Despite the rich opportunities presented by the golden age, most people in Alderwyn are simply trying to survive. The world is full of hardship, and survival is often a daily challenge, especially for the common folk. Bandits, monsters, and marauding creatures from the wilds threaten the safety of towns and villages. The poor and dispossessed struggle for basic needs while the wealthy and powerful seem to enjoy a more comfortable life. However, many seek advancement—whether it’s wealth, power, or status. Characters who rise above mere survival can become heroes or villains in a world where the boundaries between good and evil are blurred, and personal ambition is the true driving force behind many actions.

6. **The Weave and Magic**  
  Magic in Alderwyn is powerful but rare. It comes from the Weave, an energy field that connects everything in the world. While some individuals can wield arcane magic or channel divine power, most people are unaware of the deep, hidden currents of magic that flow beneath the surface of reality. The rare arcane practitioners (wizards, sorcerers, etc.) and the divine agents (clerics, warlocks) wield significant power, but they must always be cautious of magical corruption and ancient curses. Players may encounter powerful artifacts, lost magical knowledge, or even remnants of creatures and gods imbued with magic, leading to quests that explore the hidden forces behind the world's existence.

## Drama Points of the World

_Adding Drama is the way to put your world in motion. Add 5 points of drama to your world. Drama is the current affairs of your world - what’s happening right now.

Drama is a great source not only of side quests and B plots, but also of background dialogue! If you need to add more, use this expanded section._

### Drama Points of Alerwyn

_Drama Points are the current affairs, conflicts, and tensions shaping the world of Alderwyn. These events are not static; they evolve over time, presenting the characters with choices, dilemmas, and challenges that can significantly affect their journey. These points provide both immediate stakes and long-term consequences, adding layers of complexity and emotional weight to the players' actions._

1. **Beauty and Order. Or So It Seems. Chaos Still Reigns Beneath the Veil.**  
  The cities of Alderwyn appear to be in a golden age, with prosperity, order, and cultural rebirth filling the streets. However, this apparent calm hides a deep well of corruption, crime, and hidden conflict. The powerful guilds, noble houses, and merchants who control the flow of resources constantly scheme against one another, while underprivileged commoners and peasants struggle to survive. In the background, ancient forces that were quiet during the Reckoning are beginning to stir again. The players must navigate this web of illusion, balancing the need for order with the truth of the world's chaos.

2. **Each Faction and Person Vies for Power. Those Who Don’t Fight for Survival.**  
  As the Reckoning fades into history, many factions, guilds, and houses scramble for control over land, resources, and influence. The noble houses are losing their grip, while the guilds and mercenary forces rise to prominence, creating a volatile political landscape. In the lower tiers of society, survival is a daily battle as the poor and marginalized seek to scrape by in a world where wealth and power are tightly held by the elite. Will the players ally with a faction for personal gain, or try to carve their own path in this power struggle?

3. **A Renaissance World, Think 15th Century Italy but with Magic. The Moment You Leave the Cities, It Becomes a 14th Century World.**  
  In the cities, technology, art, and culture are flourishing like never before, with the renaissance bringing forward ideas and innovations unseen for centuries. Magic is often used to power inventions and create wonders, from arcane-powered inventions to towering magical structures. However, once the players venture into the countryside or remote areas, the world falls into a much more medieval and lawless state. Villages are barely holding together, and the wilds are full of dangers. The contrast between the vibrant cities and the dangerous hinterlands will influence the players’ decisions, forcing them to adapt to different environments.

4. **The Scourge Made the World, Which Was Already Dog Eat Dog, Even More Dangerous.**  
  The Scourge, a catastrophic event linked to the Reckoning, left much of the world scarred. Monsters, mutated creatures, and ancient beasts now roam the lands, attacking settlements and travelers. The world’s factions and powerful entities are not only struggling against each other but also fighting to control regions plagued by dangerous creatures and corrupted lands. This added danger has made the already cutthroat world even more brutal. The players might face a decision between saving a town from beasts** or leveraging the threat of monsters to their advantage in a political power play.

5. **The Gods Hate the Fact That There Are People Who Can Use the Weave and Aether to Perform Acts of Magic.**  
  In Alderwyn, the gods are not pleased by the increasing use of the Weave and Aether by mortals. These arcane powers, once controlled by divine beings or hidden from the common folk, are now being used by sorcerers, wizards, and artificers to perform feats that rival divine miracles. This growing arcane power threatens the gods’ dominance over the world, and they are actively seeking ways to limit or destroy the magic wielded by mortals. The players may encounter divine agents who actively work against magic users, or they may be forced to choose between seeking divine favor or embracing the power of the Weave and Aether.

6. **A Rare Medium Named Aether Can Power Technological Artifacts That Wield Great Power!**  
  Aether, a rare and mysterious substance, is capable of powering artifacts, devices, and even machines that hold great power. It is not well understood, but its uses range from creating magical constructs, transportation devices, to weapons that could shift the balance of power. However, Aether is extremely rare and difficult to control, and those who seek it often find themselves drawn into dangerous conflicts over its supply. Aether’s influence could change the course of the game, from crafting legendary items to triggering political struggles between guilds and factions who want to control this potent resource.

## Basic World Properties

Describe your world's basic properties. Make your setting feel unique with strange geographical quirks, bizarre weather, and deep magic.

### Rules of the World

_What are the fundamental differences in the natural laws of your world compared to Earth?_

_Does your world have magic or altered gravity, midichlorians or psionics? Are the gods wandering the world? Nail down your world’s natural laws now - they will have fundamental repercussions on everything else in your world! *Make sure you sense-check with your previous answers - if your genre is hard sci-fi, you might not want to introduce magic, for example._

**The World Is Ancient.** Empires rise and fall, leaving few places that have not been touched by imperial grandeur or decay. War, time, and natural forces eventually claim the mortal world, leaving it rich with places of adventure and mystery. Ancient civilisations and their knowledge survive in legends, magic items, and their ruins. Chaos and evil often follow an empire's collapse.

**The World Is Magical.** Practitioners of magic are few in number, but they leave evidence of their craft everywhere. The higher the level of magic the fewer the practitioners. The magic can be as innocuous and commonplace as a potion that heals wounds to something much more rare and impressive, such as a levitating tower or a stone golem guarding the gates of a city. Beyond the realms of civilisation are caches of magic items guarded by magic traps, as well as magically constructed dungeons inhabited by monsters created by magic, cursed by magic, or endowed with magical abilities. Magic comes from The Weave. It is an energy field that connects everything and all.

**Note.** Artificers and the like talk to the DM, you will need to use aether.

**Gods Oversee the World.** The gods are real and embody a variety of beliefs, with each god claiming dominion over an aspect of the world. Gods exert influence over the world by granting divine magic to their followers and sending signs and portents to guide them. The follower of a god serves as an agent of that god in the world. The agent seeks to further the ideals of that god and defeat its rivals. While some folk might refuse to honour the gods, none can deny their existence. Gods can't manifest themselves directly as they are incorporeal. Celestials (angels and demons) are the most used and known 'super'-agents for a deity. The more Faith a god receives the more powerfull his divinity and plentyfull celestials.

**Source of magic.** The power granted to you by your patron (cleric, warlock) is not equal to being able to manipulate the weave or what is granted to you by the primal forces. Divine is religion, the weave is arcane, and primal are the forces of nature.

## How did this world come to be? (Cosmology)

_The dominant religion, The Children of the Suns, believes that the world is the child of the twin suns, La and Tho. In reality, the world was intentionally created from a nebula by aliens who will be back to check on it someday... Write how your world ACTUALLY came to be - was it born from an egg, created by a god, or sneezed into being? You can add the prevalent in-world belief if you like. Just one paragraph on this - don't go full Silmarillion!_

The only allowed official religion is The Faith of Ohm. Although other gods exist, Ohm is the one and only official one on the continent where our adventures take place.

- As clearly stated by Law, don't lightning the messenger please.

The dominant religion, The Faith of Ohm, believes that all creation - from the multiverse as a whole to the tiniest pebble or grain of sand - is a mysterious and beautiful sign pointing to Ohm's divine power. We are in the cradle and are the origin and most perfect of all its creations.

- Who knew humans could be so self-centered?

## World Geography

_What does the geography of your world look like? Does your Geography have any special properties or features? This should be a generic vision of your geography. Is your world full of volcanoes and lava flows or floating islands? Is it an ice planet, or a desert waste? Is it a planet-city like Coruscant? Is it bio-diverse or all the same?_

_From winters which last decades (Game of Thrones, G.R.R. Martin) to moons which throw destructive spores (World of Pern, Anne MacCaffery), extraordinary geographical features can add character and challenges to your world. What are the fundamental truths of the physical geography of your world?_

_Remember to refer back to your genre, tone and motifs in your Foundation! They’ll give you a tonne of inspiration for this._

### What is the initial size of your active setting?

_What is the initial scale of your active storytelling space? An island, a region or a continent, for example? Defining your initial active setting doesn’t mean your players or main characters can’t go elsewhere! But it does help you create a starting point which feels rich and alive. Remember this will be affected by the genre! If you’re playing a Star Trek campaign, you’ll be exploring different planets, so an active area might be a solar system or a cluster of systems._

All adventures and campaigns take place in this world. The size of is as yet undefined. But the initial story starts in a small village named Kainga, near the city of Loukotokía, although everybody names it Anthill. Loukotokia could be regarded as Florence during the renaissance. A bustling city with entrepreneurial people and a flourishing trade and industry.

## People of the World

_Explore the impact of sentience in your world. Breathe life into your world with great fallen empires, forgotten cities and lost civilisations. Add conflict and drama with the struggles and politics of today._

### Who used to live here, and what’s their history?

_Write max. 1 paragraph on each lost civilisation that was active in the area. Remember you can always add more later, which have not yet been discovered! This is where the unknown mysteries come from, and a great source of dungeons, secrets, adventures, unique items and more. Also makes your world feel living and established. If you want your world to feel brand new and unsettled, write instead about the geological history of your world - the fossils that people will find._

The Akkadian are an ancient and highly-advanced species of humanoid beings who were active on what is now the Kingdom of Eden during the First Flowering. After their empire fell the Mauryan people rose to power and ruled for tens of thousands of years .After the Mauryan came the Helvetian. As the human cities grew and their borders ended, the Helvetian were the first and most vast human empire and were pivotal in the human expansion. Now the last true king of the Helvetian's is dead the empire is hit hard by the Scourge the other races are reclaiming their place on Atuaro.

From the original settler races here since the dawn of time, to the proud people and more recent humanoid races and evolutions. This paradise has an abundance of races in all sizes and colours. While the expanding human empires pushed them to the fringes, now that civilisation is crumbling they are claiming their rightful(?) place in the world.

The human nations are hungry for power, territory and resources but are ravished by the Scourge. The settler races, proud peoples, and many others were trying desperately to maintain their territories from human encroachment, as the human empires repeatedly try to seize their lands for expansion. Now the humans have lost the momentum...
