## The Dwarves — Craftsmen and Masters of Stone

The Dwarves were a proud and resilient people, their society centered around strength, craftsmanship, and honor. Their connection to the earth made them master builders and engineers.

Dwarven kingdoms were often built deep underground, where they mined precious metals, gemstones, and forged legendary weapons. Their societies were hierarchical, with kings and noble families ruling over clans, and their laws were strict and built on a deep sense of duty and loyalty.

While less attuned to arcane magic than the Elves, Dwarves were masters of runes, forging, and alchemy. They developed unique forms of magic tied to craftsmanship, using their skills to create powerful enchanted weapons and artifacts.

The Dwarves’ creations — their weapons, architecture, and magical artifacts — became legendary, and their influence spread through trade and conflict.
