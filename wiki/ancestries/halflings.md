## Halflings â€” Keepers of Joy and Community

alflings embodied simplicity, joy, and enduring community spirit. They cherished close-knit societies, valuing family, friends, and the pleasures of a well-lived life. Despite their size, they were known for their resilience and bravery when defending their homes.

Halfling villages were pastoral and self-sufficient, often hidden in hills or lush valleys. Their societies prized fairness, celebration, and mutual aid above conquest or ambition.

While not heavily magical themselves, some Halflings developed minor luck magic and enchantments tied to hearth, harvest, and protection. Their uncanny luck was seen almost as a magical gift.

Halflings' sense of stability and community helped preserve traditions and stories that otherwise would have been lost to war and ambition. They served as anchors of peace in a world increasingly turning toward conflict.
