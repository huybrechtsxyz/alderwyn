## The Gnomes â€” Innovators and Inventors

The Gnomes were known for their curiosity, invention, and innovation. They were a deeply intellectual race, focused on the pursuit of knowledge and the creation of fantastical devices.

Gnomish cities were filled with laboratories, workshops, and libraries, where the best minds of their race came together to create strange contraptions, magical devices, and alchemical concoctions. They were also renowned for their humor and wit.

The Gnomes excelled in artifice and illusion magic, combining technology and magic in ways no other race could. They were the first to create automaton creatures and other enchanted devices that served both practical and magical purposes.

The Gnomes helped lay the foundations for much of the technological and magical advances that would shape the world in later ages.
