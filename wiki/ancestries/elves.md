## The Elves â€” Masters of Elegance and Magic

The Elves were the first of the Proud Races, embodying grace, beauty, and intellectual mastery. They lived in harmony with nature and were renowned for their long lives and advanced magical understanding.

Elven society was built around honor, wisdom, and perfection. Their cities were architectural marvels, often blending seamlessly with the natural environment, and their political systems were based on councils of elders and powerful mages.

Elves were the first to formalize magic, turning it from a wild force into a refined discipline. They created the first schools of magic, and their scholars mastered many of the arcane arts, becoming the keepers of wisdom.

Their magical traditions would later influence other civilizations, and they established the first great magical academies and libraries in Alderwyn.
