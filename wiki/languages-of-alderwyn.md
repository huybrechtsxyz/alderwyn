## Celestine Dialects

### Eterna (Eternal Celestine)

The pure, timeless language of the divine. It is eternal in meaning and understood intuitively by all beings, regardless of their language. It cannot be spoken by mortals without divine intervention and has no written equivalent—its meaning cannot be captured by mortal tools. Attempts to record it result in spontaneous gibberish or bursts of unintelligible symbols. Only truly holy individuals or relics can channel this language, and doing so might require intense preparation, fasting, or divine favor.

### Litana (Liturgical Celestine)

The sacred language used by the church for scripture, rituals, and divine communication. Mortals can study and speak it, but only those with divine favor can truly master it. erves as a "scholarly divine tongue." Clerics, monks, and theologians study it as a bridge to understanding celestial mysteries.

### Vocis (Voice of Celestine)

A more practical, spoken derivative used by clerics, paladins, and other mortals for divine invocations. It incorporates fragments of Eterna but is mortal in nature, imperfect and limited. Churches may slightly alter its pronunciation. These variations sometimes create theological schisms. The everyday form used for recording scripture or theological discussion. This form lacks the divine resonance.

### High Celestine

The language of divine beings, resonating with pure meaning beyond mortal comprehension. It’s said that hearing High Celestine spoken by divine entities can heal the soul or even cause mortals to weep uncontrollably.

## Human Regional Languages

    Sund:
        A guttural, staccato language spoken in the Sundhold regions. Its sound structure makes it well-suited for command and storytelling.
        Sund employs "song cycles," epic musical chants passed down generations, which double as historical records.
    Alqaad:
        A flowing, poetic language tied to desert cultures, rich in metaphor and double meanings. Words for water and survival are sacred.
        Its script uses "sandglyphs," intricate symbols designed to mimic shifting dunes, making it one of the most visually stunning writing systems.
    Zethinian:
        Known for its melodious and complex syntax, Zethinian requires speakers to think several steps ahead in conversation.
        It uses tonal inflection, much like Mandarin or Vietnamese, making it both beautiful and treacherous to learn.

Traders (Common)

    Originally a crude pidgin for Helvetican traders, it has evolved into the lingua franca of Alderwyn.
    Evolving Slang: Traders incorporates regional slang wherever it spreads, making the language flexible but inconsistent. Some dialects are so divergent that they're nearly incomprehensible to each other.
    Unique Phrases:
        "Coin tongue" (speaking Traders).
        "Counting fingers" (understanding the gist of Traders but not fluency).
        "Lost the count" (misunderstanding the context of a conversation).

Halfling Half Cant

    Half Cant evolves constantly, with halfling communities adding new idioms every generation.
    Gestures: Half Cant relies on hand signals to complement spoken phrases, allowing for quiet or secretive communication.
        Example: A circular motion with the hand might mean "watchful" or "danger ahead."
    Unusual Idioms:
        "Borrowed a pebble" (to take a minor risk).
        "Dancing with shadows" (working with or avoiding trouble).

Arcane Scripts

    Elven Script:
        Lyrical and fluid, Elven script seems alive, with its characters almost resembling vines or flowing water. Mages claim the script "sings" to them as they write it.
        Illusion spells often require intricate Elven calligraphy to properly mask their effects.
    Draconic Runes:
        Low Draconic runes are angular and precise, reflecting the rigid, ancient traditions of dragons.
        Evocation magic often uses these runes for their inherent power. Some say that the original form of Fireball was written entirely in pure Draconic, and no one but dragons could cast it.
    Combined Forms:
        Arcane formulas combining Elven and Draconic elements require mastery of both styles. Mages who specialize in hybrid magic are rare and highly respected (or feared).

Low Draconic

    A simplified derivative of Draconic that mortal tongues can manage, Low Draconic is harsh and clipped compared to the elegant and commanding tones of true dragons.
    Grammar: Mortals struggle with Draconic's complex tenses and tonal nuances, so Low Draconic has adopted simpler structures, often omitting subtleties entirely.
    Respect Markers: Addressing a dragon in Low Draconic without using proper honorifics (like Aazir for "Great One") is a grave insult.

Exotic or Lost Languages

    Sylvani (Feytongue):
        Spoken by fey creatures, Sylvani is whimsical and strange, with a cadence resembling laughter or birdsong. Mortals who hear it often feel as though they're on the edge of understanding but never quite grasp its full meaning.
        Magical Effect: Sylvani can enchant or confuse listeners depending on the fey's intent. Attempts to write it down result in ever-shifting words that seem alive.
    Tithean (Underworld Tongue):
        A guttural and harsh language spoken by subterranean creatures and thieves' guilds. Tithean often includes coded whistles or knocks.
        Its script uses scratch-like glyphs, often carved into stone or wood.
    Aetherian (The Void Speech):
        A forbidden language tied to ancient void entities. Its words are unsettling to hear, and speaking it causes discomfort in others, as though the air itself resists its sound.













# Languages of Alderwyn (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

Custodi journals are actually recorded in Low Celestine. Mortals are incapable of speaking High Celestine. High Celestine is the language of the divine and it can be understood by any intelligent being who hears it. It can also be used to channel divine magical power and create miracles. Low Celestine is used by the church to record scripture and serves a similar purpose to that of Latin for the Catholic church throughout the middle ages and into the modern era.

There are several interesting and unusual details regarding language in Atuaro. There are several human regional languages, such as Sund, Alqaad, and Zethinian and most humans speak at least one. Common is actually more correctly called Traders. Common and evolved from a pidgin language used during the age of the Helvetican Empire to facilitate trade between different regions.

Halflings do not have a true language of their own. Rather, they speak Half Cant, a slang language composed of borrowed words from other languages, incomprehensible idioms, and hand gestures.

Arcane magic formulas generally incorporate elven script with draconic runes and usually form the basis for evocation and transmutation magic. Elven script is often used in illusion and enchantment magic. These reflect the magical traditions that originated with those races.

Non-dragons speak a debased form of draconic called Low Draconic. Because they lack forked tongues and have such different jaw structures and facial muscles, humans just can't make the same sounds that dragons can.
